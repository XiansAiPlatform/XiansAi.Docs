## What is Xians?

Xians is a **control plane** for AI agents. It sits alongside your agent framework - not replacing it - handling everything that becomes painful once agents graduate from demos to production.

Build with **any framework** (Microsoft Agent Framework, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or raw OpenAI SDK) and register it with Xians. Your agents get identity, multi-tenancy, conversation management, workflows, scheduling, and operational infrastructure - without changing your agent's code.
