# Introduction

Welcome to **Xians.ai** - the open source **Agent Control Plane (ACP)** for governing, monitoring, securing, and managing fleets of AI agents at enterprise scale.

## What is an Agent Control Plane?

An Agent Control Plane (ACP) is a centralized platform that acts as a "control tower" for autonomous AI systems. Instead of reactive guardrails, Xians provides **proactive, architectural control** for orchestrating business processes, governing multi-tenant operations, and managing agent fleets at scale across your entire organization.

Xians sits *alongside* your agent framework - not replacing it. Build agents with any framework (Microsoft Agent Framework, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or raw OpenAI SDK), then register them with Xians to get enterprise-grade orchestration, governance, monitoring, scalability, and data management.

## Core ACP Functions

| Function | What Xians Provides |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| **Governance & Multi-Tenancy** | Centralized multi-tenant isolation, multi-user coordination, agent registry, policy enforcement, template-based deployment across tenants |
| **Business Process Automation** | Fault-tolerant durable workflows, scheduled automation, event-driven triggers, human-in-the-loop processes, long-running orchestration |
| **Knowledge & Data Management** | Centralized prompt/knowledge management, document storage, conversation history, tenant-scoped data isolation |
| **Visibility & Monitoring** | Real-time logs, distributed tracing, performance metrics, cost tracking, health monitoring, audit trails |
| **Scalability & Resilience** | Horizontal agent worker scaling, subnet-isolated deployments (no incoming ports), automatic failover, distributed execution |
